#### MITRE

[Wind Analysis in Aviation Applications (2012)](/assets/WindAnalysisInAviationApplications.pdf) identifies techniques for wind analysis, including interpolation methods and patterns for distributed computation.

#### Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute

[Pricing the American Option Using Reconfigurable Hardware (2009)](/assets/PricingTheAmericanOption.pdf) explains how programmable hardware (FPGA's) can provide insanely fast, low-latency options pricing.

#### General Electric - Global Research Center

[Distributed Video Sensor Networks: Video Analytics for Force Proection (2011)](assets/VideoAnalyticsChapter.pdf) is a long chapter in a very long book, explaining several research projects we were working on in the Visualization and Computer Vision (VCV) Lab. The chapter includes a bunch of pictures, mostly of people I used to work with in the lab (it's much easier to get legal to sign off that way).

[Detection of Moving Targets from a Moving Ground Platform (2008)](/assets/DetectionOfMovingTargets.pdf) was a fun one.  We developed and evaluated a real-time, vehicle-mounted person detection system using Histogram-of-Gradient and Support Vector Machines. This research was published while working at the GE Globlal Research Center, Niskayuna NY, in the Visualization and Computer Vision (VCV) Lab.
