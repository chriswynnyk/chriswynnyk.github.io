#### MITRE

[Wind Analysis in Aviation Applications (2012)](/assets/WindAnalysisInAviationApplications.pdf) identifies techniques for wind analysis, including interpolation methods and patterns for distributed computation.

#### Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute

[Pricing the American Option Using Reconfigurable Hardware (2009)](/assets/PricingTheAmericanOption.pdf) explains how programmable hardware (FPGA's) can provide insanely fast, low-latency options pricing.

#### General Electric - Global Research Center

[Apparatus for Hybrid Engine Control and Method of Manufacturing Same (2011)](/assets/ApparatusForHybridEngineControlPatent.pdf)  is a patent from my time working in the Machines and Drives Lab at GE. The novel concept is that you can improve hybrid vehicle efficiency by considering estimated travel range in the energy system control strategy. 

[Distributed Video Sensor Networks: Video Analytics for Force Protection (2011)](assets/VideoAnalyticsChapter.pdf) is a long chapter in a very long book, explaining several research projects we were working on in the Visualization and Computer Vision (VCV) Lab. The chapter includes a bunch of pictures, mostly of people I used to work with in the lab (it's much easier to get legal to sign off that way).

[Detection of Moving Targets from a Moving Ground Platform (2008)](/assets/DetectionOfMovingTargets.pdf) was a fun one.  We developed and evaluated a real-time, vehicle-mounted person detection system using Histogram-of-Gradient and Support Vector Machines. This research was published while working at the GE Global Research Center, Niskayuna NY, in the Visualization and Computer Vision (VCV) Lab.
